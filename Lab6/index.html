                                Include a line of code within the game loop to make the particle slowly moves downwards. Use movement relative to the world, not local movement. For example:
                                <pre><code>particleModel->MoveY( -0.005f );</code></pre>

                            The particle should now fall down the screen and when it hits the bottom reappear at the top of the screen. Ensure that it is falling slowly at a value of 0.005, if this is not already the case.

                                A vector is a way of describing movement or direction. In 3D a vector is simply three numbers: x, y and z. However, these numbers now represent movement or direction instead of a location. Vectors are used throughout games development. The vector of movement for your particle is ( 0,  -0.005,  0 ).

                                As you can see, one of the immediate advantages of using a vector is that you don't have to change any code within the game loop. All you have to consider is the direction of movement and set up the appropriate vector. This is how all movement within a graphics engine is dealt with. All models within 3D graphics are moved using vectors.

                                Vectors can be combined together. This is one reason why they are so useful a tool within graphics. Imagine that there is a wind blowing across the screen from right to left. The particle is falling down but at the same time it is being pushed by the wind. This can be represented using a second vector
