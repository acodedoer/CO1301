                                You need to call the Timer() method in order to establish the first base time. The command needs to be placed outside the game loop, but make sure to place it immediately before the game loop. Call it using the following code:
                            </p>
                        <pre><code>myEngine->Timer();</code></pre>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                You then need to call Timer() once per frame, at the beginning of the game loop, immediately after:
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>myEngine->DrawScene();</code></pre>

                                Move quad back and forth across the screen from -10 to 10. Use the frame time to adjust the speed of the movement by multiplying the distance moved by the frame time. The speed of movement should be 10 units. This is a lot higher than you are used to using. However, you are now using values adjusted according to the frame time

                                Set up the W, A, S, D keys to move the camera. Use the frame time to adjust camera movement rate in the same way that you used it to adjust the movement of the quad.

                                If you are using mouse movement to rotate the camera then you do not use the frame time to adjust rotation caused by the movement of the mouse. The movement of the mouse is independent of the frame time and so does not need adjustment

                                In this way you will build a camera whose movement is independent of the speed of the computer
