                                The idea of this exercise is that we want to allow the player to sneak up behind the drone. The drone cannot see the player if the player is behind it.

                                A set of media files are available on BlackBoard. You need to use the Floor.x mesh to create a floor model, drone.x to create a drone model, and either sierra.x, Casual_A.x,marine.x or the Bikergirl.x to create a player model.

                                Create models for the floor, the player and the drone. You will need to scale the drone down by a factor of 0.05 (use drone->Scale(0.05f)) and make sure it is positioned above the floor so that it appears to be hovering.

                                You will need to calculate the vector from the drone to the player each frame. In order to do this, take the location of the player and subtract the location of the drone from it. This should be implemented in the game-loop, and the x, y and z components of the vector should be stored in appropriately named float variables e.g. drone2PlayerVx, drone2PlayerVy and drone2PlayerVz.
                            </p>

                                We also need the drone's facing vector. In order to calculate this you have to carry out some work with its matrix. We haven't covered matrices yet, so a function that will calculate the facing vector from a given model is provided below:
                            </p>
<pre><code>void facingVector( IModel *model, float &x, float &y, float &z)
{
    float matrix[16];

    model->GetMatrix( matrix );

    x = matrix[8];
    y = matrix[9];
    z = matrix[10];
}

                        </div>
                    </li>

                                Assuming that the model of the drone is called "drone" and we have three floating point variables ready to store the facing vector of the guard:
                            </p>
<pre><code>float facingVx;
float facingVy;
float facingVz;</code></pre>
                            <p>You would then call the function like this:</p>
                            <pre><code>facingVector( drone, facingVx, facingVy, facingVz );</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                Note that the function does not return any value, but is able to update the values of facingVx, facingVy and facingVz as they are passed by reference.
                            </p>

                                Now write a function that will calculate the dot product of two V and W, it will be used to calculate the dot product if the two vectors derived in the last section. The function should take in as parameters the componenets of V and W, and return the dot product (a float). The function declaration (or function prototype) looks like this:
                                <pre><code>float dotProduct( float Vx, float Vy, float Yz, float Wx, float Wy, float Wz );</code></pre>
                                Add this before your program's main function.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Below the closing brace of the main function, write the actual function. You need to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>write the function declaration without the ending semi-colon</li>
                                <li>add curly brackets (braces) and place the body of the code within the curly brackets.</li>
                            </ul>
<pre><code>float dotProduct( float Vx, float Vy, float Yz, float Wx, float Wy, float Wz )
{
    // body of code here
}</code></pre>
                        </div>

                                The function prototype specifies that you need to supply the function with two vectors. The body of the function needs to calculate the dot product of the two vectors. The dot product is calculated using the following formula:
                            </p>
                            v&#183w = (v<sub>x</sub>w<sub>x</sub> + v<sub>y</sub>w<sub>y</sub> + v<sub>z</sub>w<sub>z</sub>)
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                To recap: in order to find out whether the drone can see the player you:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use the facingVector() function to find out the facing vector of the drone.</li>
                                <li>Calculate the vector from the drone to the player.</li>
                                <li>Calculate the dot product between these two vectors.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                                Having done these steps you finally apply the following test:

                                    <li>Assuming the facing vector (the orientation) of the drone be v and the vector from the drone to the player be w.</li>
                                    <li>If v&#183w > 0 then the angle is less that 90 degrees, if v&#183w &lt 0 then the angle is greater that 90 degrees, and if v&#183w = 0 then the angle is exactly 90 degrees.</li>
                                    <li>Therefore if v&#183w &lt 0 then the player is behind the guard and not visible to the guard.</li>
                                </ul>
