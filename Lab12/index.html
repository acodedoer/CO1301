                                The idea of this exercise is that we want to allow the player to sneak up behind the drone, and that is possible because the drone cannot see the player if the player is behind it.

You need to use the floor.x mesh to create a floor model, drone.x to create a drone model, and either sierra.x, casual_A.x or bikegirl.x to create a player model. Set up the models as follows:
                            </p>

                                <li>Create the player model at (0,0,-5)</li>

                                When you run your program you should see the player near the bottom of the screen and facing the drone; the drone should be positioned around the centre of your screen and facing forward.

                                In the next section, we will find out whether the drone can see the player or not by calculating a value that tells us whether the player is behind the drone or not. The value is calculated by taking the dot-product of the vector between the drone and the player, and the drone's facing vector (which tells us where the drone is facing).

                                        <li>Therefore if the dot product is less than 0 then the player is behind the drone and not visible to the drone.</li>

                            The tasks that follow describe the implementation of these steps.

                                Calculate the vector from the drone to the player by subtracting the x,y and z components of the drone's position from that of the player's position. This should be implemented in the game-loop, and the x, y and z components of the resulting vector should be stored in a vector (created from the Vector3 struct you created in 2.6) called drone2PlayerVector.
                            </p>

                                To calculate the drone's facing vector, you have to carry out some work with the drone's matrix. But We haven't covered matrices yet, so let us use a less efficient approach. Since the facing vector is just the vector that describes the direction in which an object is facing, we can find out what that vector is if we move the drone along its local z-axis by any value, and calculate the vector between the old  and the new position of the drone (of course we will then have to move the drone back). Let's put this "trick" in a function that takes in a Vector3 and a model, calculates and assigns the components of the model's facing vector to the components of the Vector3 it received as parameters.
                            </p>
<pre><code>void calculateFacingVector( IModel *model, Vector3 &facingVector)
{
    float initialPosX = model->GetX();
    float initialPosY = model->GetY();
    float initialPosZ = model->GetZ();

    model->MoveLocalZ(1.0f);

    float finalPosX = model->GetX();
    float finalPosY = model->GetY();
    float finalPosZ = model->GetZ();

    facingVector.x = finalPosX - initialPosX;
    facingVector.y = finalPosY - initialPosY;
    facingVector.z = finalPosZ - initialPosZ;

    model->MoveLocalZ(-1.0f);
}
</code></pre>
                            <p>Add the function to your code so you can call it to calculate the drone's facing vector.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">

                                Assuming that the model of the drone is called "drone" and we have a Vector3 variable ready to store the facing vector of the guard:
                            </p>
<pre><code>Vector3 droneFacingVector;</code></pre>
                            <p>You would then call the function like this:</p>
                            <pre><code>calculateFacingVector( drone, droneFacingVector );</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                Note that the function does not return any value, but can update the values of droneFacingVector.x, droneFacingVector.y and droneFacingVector.z as they are passed by reference.

                                Now write a function that will calculate the dot product of two vectors v and w. The function should take in as parameters two Vector3 vectors V and W, and return their dot product (a float). The function declaration (or function prototype) looks like this:
                                <pre><code>float calculateDotProduct( Vector3 v, Vector3 w );</code></pre>
                                Add this before your program's main function.

                                The function prototype specifies that you need to supply the function with two vectors. The body of the function needs to calculate the dot product of the two vectors. The dot product is calculated using the following formula: v&#183w = (v.x * w.x + v.y * w.y + v.z * w.z)

                                Update the code in your game-loop so that both droneFacingVector and drone2PlayerVector are normalised before the dot product is calculated. Check out Lecture 6, Lab 6 and Lab 7 if you need a reminder on normalising vectors.

                                Can you see a difference in the values of the dot-product displayed by the program?

                                Add code in your game-loop that rotates the drone about its local y-axis. This means you will have to keep moving the player to avoid being seen by the drone.

                                Extend this program into a game; the game's objective is to deactivate the drone.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The player needs to touch the drone to deactivate it, therefore implement collision detection between the drone and the player (use sphere to sphere collision detection, you can reuse the function from last week's lab). Take the radius of the player's bounding sphere to be 0.2f, and that of the drone's bounding sphere to be 1.0f.</li>
                                    <li>If the player collides with the drone, resolve the collision to make sure the player is not stuck inside the drone and display an appropriate victory message on the screen (centred vertically and horizontally).</li>
                                    <li>The player loses if seen by the drone, therefore if the player is within the drone's field of view a GameOver message should be displayed on the screen (centred vertically and horizontally).</li>
                                    <li>Right now the player is within the drone's field of view if the dot product is greater than 0. Is that realistic? Can you have a more realistic field of view?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
