The y coordinate of the spheres need to be changed in order to produce a sine wave. Therefore, you need to set the y coordinate of each sphere to sin(x), where x is simply the current x coordinate of the sphere. You will need to:

                                A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. To define a method you have to specify a name for it, its return type (void if does not return a value), its parameters (type and order of its required input(s)), and the functions body i.e. its code.

                                The rotateSpheres() function will need to take the array of spheres and the array of degrees as parameters. When the identifier (the name) of an array is used as a parameter, the whole array is passed over. In order to pass an array over to a function, the receiving function needs:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the data type of the array (int, char, float, etc.)</li>
                                <li>the size of the array</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Therefore your function definition should be similar to the code below:

<pre><code>void rotateSpheres( IModel* rotationArray[], float degreeArray[], int sizeOfArrays )
