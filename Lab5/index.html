            <h2>2. Removing a Model from the Game Scene</h2>
            <div class="section_instrcutions"></div>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Whenever we want to create a model, we use the 'CreateModel' method of an IMesh* variable. 
<pre><code>IMesh* sphereMesh = myEngine->CreateModel("Sphere.x"); //declare variable and load mesh 
IModel* sphere = sphereMesh->CreateModel( ); //declare variable and create model
</code></pre>
                                It is also possible to remove a model using the 'RemoveModel' method of its mesh. For example, the code below will remove the 'sphere' created in the code above:
<pre><code>sphereMesh->RemoveModel( sphere ); //remove model</code></pre>
                                Note that the 'RemoveModel' method is passed the IModel* variable of the model to be removed as a paramter.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                The removal of a model means that it is completely destroyed. It is no longer possible to use the model since it no longer exists and, indeed, if you tried (for example) to move the model after removal you would generate a real time error.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>  
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Although the model has been destroyed the IModel* variable still exists. This is because the IModel* variable is a particular kind of variable called a pointer, which is declared using an asterisk (*). The pointer still exists, but the removal of the model means it no longer has anything to point at. However, the IModel variable can be re-used to point to a newly created model. For example, the code below serves no real purpose but it does show this process of removing a model and reusing its IModel* variable:
<pre><code>IModel* sphere = sphereMesh->CreateModel( ); // declare variable and create model
sphereMesh->RemoveModel( sphere ); // remove model
sphere = sphereMesh->CreateModel( ); // create new model
</code></pre>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>  
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">In the next section, we will create a code that removes or creates a sphere when the 'Retun Key' is hit, based on the state of the game.

                                The logic of the program we want to code is as follows:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If the Return key is hit and the sphereState is 1, this means that sphere exists, therefore the sphere model is removed and the sphereState is set to 0.</li>
                                    <li>If the Return key is hit and the sphereState is 0, this means that sphere does not exist, therefore the sphere model is created and the sphereState is set to 1.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                The code to implement this looks as follows (it should be added to the game loop):
<pre><code>if( myEngine->KeyHit( Key_Return ) )
{
    if( sphereState == 1 )
    {
        sphereMesh->RemoveModel( sphere );
        sphereState = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        sphere = sphereMesh->CreateModel( 0, 10, 0 );
        sphereState = 1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
                                In this fashion you can track the state of your program. In this particular example you are keeping track of whether or not the sphere model exists. Furthermore, you are using the state of the sphere to determine what action the program needs to take: whether to create the sphere or to remove it. States are used extensively within game programming and throughout software engineering in general.

                                                        When the Space Key is hit playerCube should move up until it is directly beneath the top platform. It should appear as if playerCube moved up and stopped after hitting the top platform.

                                                        Pressing the Space Key again should make the cube move down until it is positioned on the bottom platform.

                                                        Basically, hitting the Space Key should make playerCube move to the opposite platform.

                                        To implement this logic, start by creating a Enumeration named EPositionState outside of the game loop for storing the two possible positions of playerCube (Top and Bottom). Then create an enum variable of type EPositionState named playerPosition and initialise it to Bottom as you want playerCube to be positioned on the bottom platform when the game starts.
<pre><code>enum EPositionState {Bottom, Top};
EPositionState playerPosition = Bottom;</code></pre>
                                    </p>

                                        Next write code to check if the Space key is hit, if it is then check the playerPosition and change it change it.
<pre><code>if (myEngine->KeyHit(Key_Space)) {
    if (playerPosition == Bottom) {
        playerPosition = Top;
    }
    else {

                                        Next, define a constant float named kGravity and give it a value of 0.5f. Then in the game loop, write code to check the positionState and:

                                                If the positionState is Bottom, then playerCube should be moved down using <code>playerCube->MoveY(-kGravity)</code> until its Y position is such that it appears to be sitting on the bottom platform ( Hint: playerCube's Y position should not be less than the lowest Y value you noted in Task 4.6 )
                                            </li>

                                            </li>

                                    Rather than moving playerCube, it will be more efficient to move the platforms and the background to create the illusion of playerCube's movement. Another advantage of this is that once the platforms and the background exit the camera's view from one side they can be recycled into view from the other side to create an endless platformer. But for this approach to work we need addional models (two platforms and a background).</p>
                                    <p>Therefore use platform.x to create models for platform3 at ( 260, 60, 0 ) and platform4 at ( 260, -60, 0 ); then use background.x to create  background2 model at ( 260, 0, 10 ).

                                    To have a better view of how these models and what will be created using them, change your camera type to kFPS so that you can zoom out and move around to have a better look at all the models in the scene.

                                    To improve efficieny, we are going to use parenting to create two sets of models each containg two platforms and a background. Therefore use the AttachToParent( ) method to attach platform1 and platform2 to background1; and attach platform3 and platform4 to background2.

                                    When you run your program, you should notice that the position of your platforms has changed. This is beacuse when a model is attached as a child to another model, the orign of the child model is no longer the world origin but the origin of the parent model. Therefore you will have to reposition your platforms relative to their parents using SetLocalPosition( ).</p>
<pre><code>platform1->SetLocalPosition(0, 60, -10); // at the top and in front of background1

                                    Next, define a constant float named kGameSpeed and initialise it to -0.05f. Then in the game loop add code to move background1 and background2 along the x axis using kGameSpeed. When you run your program, each background and its children (platforms) should be moving to the left thus creating the illusion that the cube is moving to the right.

Position enemy2 in front of background2 so that it appears to sit on platform4. Use 0 as the X position when positioning both enemies.
