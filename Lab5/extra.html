                                Rather than moving the player on the platform, it will be more efficient to move the platform underneadt the player and the background behind the platform to create an issusion o fth eplayer's movement. This way once the platform and the background are out of view they can be recyceld into view from the other side creating an endless platformer. However in additon to the set of two platforms and a background model taht we have created, we need another set so that as one set goes out of view another is brough into view.

This is because the IModel* variable is a particular kind of variable called a pointer, which is declared using an asterisk (*). The pointer still exists, but the removal of the model means it no longer has anything to point at. However, the IModel variable can be re-used to point to a newly created model. For example, the code below serves no real purpose but it does show this process of removing a model and reusing its IModel* variable:
<pre><code>IModel* particle = particleMesh->CreateModel( ); // declare variable and create model
particleMesh->RemoveModel( particle ); // remove model
particle = particleMesh->CreateModel( ); // create new model
