                                Each model has a 4x4 matrix associated with it, this means that you can directly manipulate the matrix in order to perform graphics operations on the model.

                                The matrix for a model is obtained using the GetMatrix() method. The following code gets the matrix of the cube and places it into the 4x4 array:
                            </p>
<pre><code>float matrix[4][4];
cube->GetMatrix( &matrix[0][0] );</code></pre>

                                The matrix can be then be manipulated in whatever way we see fit. After the matrix has been changed the new matrix can be assigned to the model using the SetMatrix() method. The following code sets the matrix of cube:
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>cube->SetMatrix( &matrix[0][0] );</code></pre>

                                <b>Note:</b> The use of the ampersand (&) in this context means "obtain the address of". The matrix associated with the model is a single dimensional floating point array of size 16, i.e. float m[16]. However, I think it'll be easier for you to visual the matrix as a two-dimensional array of size 4 by 4, i.e. float n[4][4]. In practice the two array declarations are treated identically by the compiler. But in order to convert from the one format to other it is necessary to pass the base address of the 4x4 matrix over to the function and this is what the ampersand allows us to do: it states the address of the first element of the array is passed over to the function.
                            </p>

                                The last row of the matrix is the position of the model:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>matrix[3][0] is the x-coordinate</li>
                                    <li>matrix[3][1] is the y-coordinate</li>
                                    <li>matrix[3][2] is the z-coordinate</li>

                                So if the value of matrix[3][0] is changed and the matrix assigned to cube model then the cube will move along the x-axis. Note that the other elements of the matrix must be left unaltered else the cube will be transformed in other ways and not just moved along the x-axis
