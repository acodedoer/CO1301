                                You can use TL-Engine scaling functions (Scale()) to make models larger or smaller. This will allow you to use the same planet mesh to create models for the Sun, the Earth and all the other planets - you scale each one differently to create appropriate sizes.

                                There is also another engine function SetFarClip that changes how far away you can see. In a space game you can see very far so this is needed, use it when objects are “clipped” in the distance:

                                Begin by creating the Earth (at the origin) and the moon ( to the Earth's side) uisng the "Planet.x" mesh and the appropriate texture for each body. Place them close enough together so that you can see them both comfortably (remember, this is not meant to be realistic). You will have to scale the  model down for the moon.
                            </p>

                                You may want to position your models at 10.0 along the y-axis, so that they are almost centered within the camera's view.

                            <p>Remember, this means that the moon's position is now relative to the position of earth. Therefore, you may need to adjust the coordinates used to position it.</p>

                                This is all well and good, but what would happen if you wanted the Earth and the Moon to rotate at a different speeds? The way things are set up at the moment the Earth must rotate around its axis at the same speed that the Moon rotates around the Earth. It is possible to set up the scene so that the Earth and the Moon rotate at different speeds and this is by introducing a dummy model using the "Dummy.x" mesh. You load and use the dummy model in exactly the same way as any other mesh and model. The difference is that the dummy is never rendered: it is just an invisible point in space.

                <h2>5. Using Functions for Collision Detection</h2>
                <div class="section_instrcutions"></div>
                    <ol> 
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">

                               Right now our program contains sphere to sphere collision detection between the sun and the spaceship. If we were to implement sphere to sphere collision between the spaceship and all the other bodies without using functions, our game-loop could get messy quickly. Let us, therefore, create a sphere to sphere collision detection function that we can call anytime we want to check for a collision between the spacehsip and any of the other bodies in our program.  
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li> 
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">

                               The sphere to sphere collision dectection function should check if there is a collision between two objects bounded by spheres. Therefore it needs to know the position of the objects and their radii of the spheres. If there is a collision it should return True, and return False is there is no collision. Use the code below to declare the function, the declaration should be placed before the start of the program's main function
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>bool sphere2Sphere(float s1XPos,  float s1ZPos, float s1Radius, float s2XPos, float s2ZPos, float s2Radius);</code></pre>
                        </div>
                    </li>   
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Next, define the function below the closing brace of the main function.
                            </p>
<pre><code>bool sphere2Sphere(float s1XPos, float s1ZPos, float s1Radius, float s2XPos, float s2ZPos, float s2Radius) {
        float distX = s2XPos - s1XPos;
        float distZ = s2ZPos - s1ZPos;
        float distance = sqrt(distX*distX + distZ*distZ);
        bool collision;
        if (distance < (s1Radius + s2Radius)) {
            collision = true;
        }
        else {
            collision = false;
        }
    
        return collision;
}</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                The function takes in the x and z positions of two sphere volumes (why do you think the Y position is ignored in this case?) and their radii, calculates the distance between the spheres, compare the distance with the sum of their radii, returns true to show there is a collision if the distance is less than the radii sum, or returns false to show there is no collision if the distance is greater than the radii sum.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                               You can now call this function inside your gameloop to check for collisions. Use the GetX() and GetZ() functions to get the position of an object, and make sure you take scaling into consideration when providng the radius of an object (e.g. a planet that is not scaled has radius 1, a planet scaled up to 2 has radius 2, while a planet scaled down to 0.5 has radius 0.5). An example of the use of the function is shown below:
                            </p>
<pre><code>if(sphere2Sphere(earth->GetX(), earth->GetY(), earth->GetZ(), 1, ss->GetX(), ss->GetY(), ss->GetZ(), 4)){
    myEngine->Stop();
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    The spaceship in its default scale has a radius of about 4.0f, you can get a more exact value using its bouding box coordinates found within it's mesh file.

                                Using the sphere2sphere function, update your gameloop to check for collision between the spacehsip and all the bodies in your solar system.

                                Try and optimise the collision detection function based on what whas covered in the lecture this week?
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                You can reuse this function in other programs. You should also try defining functions for other collision detection approaches so you can easily reuse them.
