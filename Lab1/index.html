You can use a built-in C++ function in your own code when you want to perform a calculation or task – it saves you from writing the code yourself. There are some C++ functions that you may have seen already:</p>

                                <code>float squareRoot = sqrt(16); // sqrt is a standard C++ function to calculate the square root of a number

                                <p class= "instruction-item">In the ‘sqrt’ example notice how the number 16 is “passed” to the function (in brackets) i.e. given as input to the function.

                        </div>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">In the second example, the string “pause” is passed to the ‘System’ function, but there is no result – this function simply performs a task (waits for a key press).</p>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">You will see functions like this in the TL-Engine. Some are passed values (sometimes several values), and some are not. Also some return results, although again, some don’t.</p>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">The use of each function will be explained to you in the worksheets, with examples given. You will see functions shortly in CO1404 too.</p>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">Finally, most functions in the TL-Engine must be used through a variable:</p>
                                <pre><code>I3DEngine* myEngine; // I3Dengine is a TL-Engine specific variable type
                                    myEngine->DrawScene(); // DrawScene is a function (“method”) of myEngine
                            </code></pre>
                            
                            In the above code, a variable named "myEngine" is declared, then "DrawScene" is used on the variable (notice the use of the ‘->’ symbol to indicate this usage). In plain English, the two lines of code state: "create a 3D engine and call it myEngine, then use myEngine to draw a scene”. Functions like DrawScene() are called methods. Notice the use of the ‘->’ symbol to indicate this usage.</p>

                             <p class= "instruction-item">The game code structure has three sections to help you setup, run and terminate your game properly. These sections are <em>initialisation</em>, <em>game loop</em>, and <em>termination.</em>
                             </p>

                                <li>Initialisation: everything that is needed to get the game going is setup in this section. This usally includes loading resources (e.g. models, sounds and images) needed for the game, initialising game engine variables and initialising game object variables (e.g. player name and player score) </li><br/>
                                <li>The game loop: the code in the game loop section takes over once initialisation is complete. Just as the name implies, code in this section executes in an endless loop (until told to stop). Without the game loop, your game code will execute only once and the game will end in a flash. In each iteration of the game loop, the game checks for the player's input (e.g. whether the right button is pressed), does some calculations (e.g. calculate the avatar's new position after moving one step to the right), outputs the resulting changes to the screen (e.g. displays the avatar in its new position), and starts a new iteration (if game is not over). The game loop's ability to perform several of its iterations every second and display static images called <em>frames</em> creates the animation you see when you play games. Objects change position very slightly from frame to frame but the viewer does not perceive the separate images, and instead sees an animation scene.</li><br/>
                                <li>Termination: this section executes when the game loop ends and you want to terminate your game. This sections is used to execute code that cleans up after your game, and releases resources. All resources that are taking up precious computer memory must be properly released to the reclaim that memory. For example, memomry allocated for models, images and sounds need to be released by the end of the game</li>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">Now let us have a detailed look at the TL-Engine template code and see how it provides the basic game code structure, similar to that shown in the previous section:</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li >
                        <div class="list-div">
                                <p class= "instruction-item">After the opening comment the TL-Engine file is included, this contains all the information needed to use the engine. Following the include statement is a "using namespace" statement: all of the TL-Engine is “hidden” inside a ‘namespace’ so it does not get mixed up with standard C++ or other libraries. This statement says that we want to expose the contents of the namespace so we can use its contents easily. These opening lines must begin all programs using the TL-Engine, you do not need to understand their detail, just make sure they are there.</p>
                                <pre><code>// First Project.cpp: A program using the TL-Engine
                                        #include  < TL-Engine.h > // TL-Engine include file and namespace
                                        using namespace tle;
                                </code></pre>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li >
                        <div class="list-div">
                                <p class= "instruction-item">In the next lines we see the ‘main’ function, it is where the execution of all C++ programs begin.</p>
                                <pre><code>void main()
                                        {

                                    Then main function begins with the initialisation section, which has the code provided below:

                                I3DEngine* myEngine = New3DEngine( kTLX );
                                myEngine->StartWindowed();

                            <p>In code above, first a variable called ‘myEngine’ is declared and its type is an ‘I3DEngine*’. All you need to know now is that the variable ‘myEngine’ will be your interface to the TL-Engine - you will use the TL-Engine's features “through” this variable.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>After declaring the ‘myEngine’ variable, it is initialised by using a function/method:‘New3DEngine(kTLX)’. In plain English that means “I want to use a 3D engine of the kTLX variety, and I will call it myEngine”</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>The next line is the first use of this new engine we have prepared. See how we use "myEngine->StartWindowed()" to say, “I want myEngine to start up in a window”.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>The next line tells the engine to look in the folder provided (the folder chosen when TL-Engine was installed) for any files (e.g. 3D objects) that you load later on. Any resources you want to load to your game, should be loaded after this line of code.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li >

                            <p class= "instruction-item">Next comes the game loop section of the template code.
                            <pre><code>	// The main game loop, repeat until engine is stopped
                                    while (myEngine->IsRunning())
                                    {
                                        // Draw the scene

                            </code></pre>
                            This section contains a ‘while’ loop that repeats until the engine stops (generally, the engine only stops when its window is closed). Currently the only code inisde this loop is code that tells the 3D engine  declared in the initialisation stage (myEngine) to draw the scene.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li >
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">The final section, the termination section is found after the game loop section. It contains a single line of code that deletes the 3D engine that you created at the beginning:
                            <pre><code>	// Delete the 3D engine now we are finished with it
                                    myEngine->Delete();
                            </code></pre>
                            If we don’t do this then the resources used by the 3D engine will remain in the computer’s memory after the program is finished, but no other program will be able to access them. This is called a memory leak - it will affect the performance of the computer, so this line is important.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">In this section you will add code to the template code that loads a mesh, creates a model and a camera to display your scene.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">Start by adding the code below in the initialisation section. Place it below <code>/**** Set up your scene here ****/</code>
                            <pre><code>IMesh* cubeMesh;
                                IModel* cube;
                            </code></pre>
                            The above code declares two variables, a mesh variable and a model variable. Note how they use the same pointer syntax (*) as before when declaring a 3D engine variable, these variables will be used in the same way as ‘myEngine’.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A mesh is a 3D object generated by an artist and saved in a file. A model is a single copy of a mesh in our scene. At first, this might seem similar - but remember that a single mesh can be used to create several models in your scene (e.g. we may have one mesh of a tree, but make a forest in our game using 20 models created from this mesh). Consider a mesh as a ‘blueprint’ for real models.</p>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">Next, type the code below: 
                            <pre><code>cubeMesh = myEngine->LoadMesh( "Cube.x" );
                                    cube = cubeMesh->CreateModel();
                            </code></pre>
                            The first line here uses the 3D engine (named myEngine) to load a file into your declared mesh variable (cubeMesh). Notice how you need to go ‘through’ the variable ‘myEngine’ again using "->". You can think about this as asking myEngine to perform a service for you (loading a mesh) - the 3D engine must do this job, as it needs to keep track of all new meshes. So in English, the code is saying:
                            “Use myEngine to load a mesh called 'cube.x' and assign it to the variable ‘cubeMesh’ ”
                            <br/><br/>
                            Then the mesh is used as a blueprint to create a real model in the scene. Note that the syntax is similar to what was used to load the mesh using the 3D engine, but this time the mesh is used to create a model. In English, the code is saying: “Use the cubeMesh blueprint to create a model in the scene and assign it to the variable ‘cube’ ”</p>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">The last piece of code you need to add to the initialisation section is the code below:

                            </code></pre>
                            The first line declares a variable named 'myCamera' that will be used hold a camera. The second line of code uses a similar syntax similar to what you have used when loading a mesh and creating a model. In English the code is saying: “Use myEngine to create a camera of type FPS and assign it to the variable myCamera”. FPS is a "first person shooter" camera that can be moved around with the mouse and cursor keys.</p>

                                We are now done with the initialisation section and the game loop section already has code that draws the scene when the game is executed. Therefore when you run the project now, the 3D engine draws the  scene using the viewpoint of our camera - the scene will be drawn into the window we opened earlier (in the initialisation section). We asked for a controllable FPS camera, so the image drawn will update and change as we move the camera around uisng keyboard or mouse.

                            When you run your project your FPS camera may be moving too fast, you can add a delya loop to slow it down. Add the code that follows inside the game loop immediately after <code>/**** Update your scene each frame here ****/</code> and run your project again.
