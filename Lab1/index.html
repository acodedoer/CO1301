You can use a built-in C++ function in your own code when you want to perform a calculation or task – it saves you from writing the code yourself. There are some C++ functions that you may have seen already:</p>

                            In the above code, a variable named "myEngine" is declared, then "DrawScene" is used on the variable. In plain English it means “use myEngine to draw the scene”. This kind of function is called a “method”. Notice the use of the ‘->’ symbol to indicate this usage.</p>

Following the include statement is a "using namespace" statement: all of the TL-Engine is “hidden” inside a ‘namespace’ so it does not get mixed up with standard C or other libraries. This statement says that we want to expose the contents of the namespace so we can use its contents easily. These opening lines must begin all programs using the TL-Engine, you do not need to understand their detail, just make sure they are there.</p>

                            Here we are declaring two variables, a mesh and a model. Note how they use the same pointer syntax as before, these variables will be used in the same way as ‘myEngine’.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A mesh is a 3D object generated by an artist and saved in a file. A model is a single copy of a mesh in our scene. At first, this might seem similar - but remember that there can be several copies of a particular mesh in the scene (e.g. we may have one mesh of a tree, but make a forest in our game using 20 models created from this mesh). Consider a mesh as a ‘blueprint’ for real models.

                            </code></pre>
                            The first line here uses the 3D engine to load a file into our mesh variable. Notice how we need to go ‘through’ the variable ‘myEngine’ again using "->". You can think about this as asking the 3D engine to perform a service for us (loading a mesh) - the 3D engine must do this job, as it needs to keep track of all new meshes. So in English:
                            “Use myEngine to load a mesh called 'cube.x' that we will call ‘cubeMesh’ ”
                            <br/><br/>
                            Then we use this mesh as a blueprint to create a real model in the scene. We use the same kind of syntax as before, but this time using the mesh. English: “Use the cubeMesh blueprint to create a model in the scene that we will call ‘cube’ ”

                            We first declare a variable to hold a camera. Then we ask the 3D engine to create a camera to look at the scene. We specify a FPS type camera that can be moved around with the mouse and cursor keys. The code style is the same as before. In English “Use myEngine to create an FPS camera that we will call ‘myCamera’ ”
