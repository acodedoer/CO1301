The data type of a variable must be stated when declaring it to specify the type of data that the variable can store. Examples of variable declaration in C++ are shown below:</p>
                                
<pre><code>int length; // an integer variable named length is declared for storing whole numbers
string name; // a string variable named name is declared for storing text data

check = true; // then check is assigned a value of true</code></pre>

                            Note: Assignment is not the same as 'equals'!

<pre><code>I3DEngine* myEngine; // I3Dengine is a TL-Engine specific type for storing instances of a 3D engine</code></pre>

                            The type 'I3DEngine*' is not a C++ type; it is specific to the TL-Engine. Also note that it is being used with a 'pointer' – the symbol '*'. You will be introduced to both custom types and pointers later in CO1401. For now just remember that 'I3DEngine*' is a type just like an int or a float, but specific to the TL-Engine.

                            <p class= "instruction-item">The TL-Engine has many 'functions' that you can use. A function is a block of program code that performs a particular calculation or task. You can use a built-in C++ function in your own code when you want to perform a calculation or task – it saves you from writing the code yourself. There are some C++ functions that you may have seen already:</p>

<pre><code>float squareRoot = sqrt(16); // sqrt() is a standard C++ function to calculate the square root of a number
system( "pause" ); // system() is a function that issues a special system command to the computer</code></pre>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">In the 'sqrt' example notice how the number 16 is 'passed' to the function (in brackets) i.e. given as input to the function. Also notice that the 'sqrt' function calculates a result – and this result is put into the variable 'SquareRoot'. </p>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">In the second example, the string 'pause' is passed to the 'System' function, but there is no result – this function simply performs a task (waits for a key press).</p>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">You will see functions like this in the TL-Engine. Some are passed values (sometimes several values), and some are not. Also some return results, although again, some don't. The use of each function will be explained to you in the worksheets, with examples given.</p>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">Finally, most functions in the TL-Engine must be used through a variable:</p>

<pre><code>I3DEngine* myEngine; // I3Dengine is a TL-Engine specific variable type
myEngine->DrawScene(); // DrawScene is a function ("method") of myEngine </code></pre>
                            
                            In the above code, a variable named 'myEngine' is declared, then 'DrawScene()' is used on the variable (notice the use of the '->' symbol to indicate this usage). In plain English, the two lines of code state: "create a 3D engine and call it myEngine, then use myEngine to draw a scene". Functions like DrawScene() are called methods.</p>

Following the include statement is a "using namespace" statement: all of the TL-Engine is 'hidden' inside a 'namespace' so it does not get mixed up with standard C++ or other libraries. This statement says that we want to expose the contents of the namespace so we can use its contents easily. These opening lines must begin all programs using the TL-Engine, you do not need to understand their detail, just make sure they are there.</p>

                                    The main function begins with the initialisation section. Everything that is needed to get the game going is setup in this section. This includes initialising variables and loading resources (e.g. models and sounds).
                            </p>      

<pre><code>// Create a 3D engine (using TLX engine here) and open a window for it

                            <p>In the code above, a variable called 'myEngine' is declared and its type is an 'I3DEngine*'. All you need to know now is that the variable 'myEngine' will be your interface to the TL-Engine, meaning you will use the TL-Engine's features 'through' this variable.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>After declaring the 'myEngine' variable, it is initialised by using a function/method: 'New3DEngine(kTLX)''. In plain English that means "I want to use a 3D engine of the TLX variety, and I will call it myEngine".</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>The next line is the first use of this new engine we have prepared. See how we use "myEngine->StartWindowed()" to say, "I want myEngine to start up in a window".</p>

                            <p>The next line tells the engine to look in the folder provided (the folder chosen when TL-Engine was installed) for any files (e.g. 3D objects) that you load later on. Any resources you want to load to your game, should be loaded after this line of code.</p>
                        </div>

    /**** Update your scene each frame here ****/
}</code></pre>

                            Currently the only code inisde this game loop is code that tells the 3D engine declared in the initialisation stage (myEngine) to draw the scene. Code can be added to the game loop to check for player input and update game objects in each iteration. The game loop's ability to perform several iterations every second and display updated <em>frames</em> creates the animation seen when playing games.

<pre><code>// Delete the 3D engine now we are finished with it
myEngine->Delete();</code></pre>

                            If we don't do this then the resources used by the 3D engine will remain in the computer's memory after the program is finished, but no other program will be able to access them. This is called a memory leak - it will affect the performance of the computer, so this line is important.

<pre><code>IMesh* cubeMesh;
IModel* cube;</code></pre>

                            The above code declares two variables, a mesh variable and a model variable. Note how we use the same pointer syntax (*) as before when declaring a 3D engine variable, these variables will be used in the same way as 'myEngine'.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A mesh is a 3D object generated by an artist and saved in a file. A model is a single copy of a mesh in our scene. At first, this might seem similar - but remember that a single mesh can be used to create several models in your scene (e.g. we may have a single tree mesh, but make a forest in our game using 20 models created from this mesh). Consider a mesh as a 'blueprint' for creating models.</p>

<pre><code>cubeMesh = myEngine->LoadMesh( "Cube.x" );
cube = cubeMesh->CreateModel();</code></pre>

                            The first line here uses the 3D engine (myEngine) to load a file and put it into our declared mesh variable (cubeMesh). Notice how we need to go 'through' the variable 'myEngine' again using "->". Think about this as asking myEngine to perform a service for us (loading a mesh) - the 3D engine must do this job, as it needs to keep track of all new meshes. So in English, the code is saying:
                            "Use myEngine to load a mesh called 'cube.x' and put it in the variable 'cubeMesh' ".
                            <br/><br/>
                            In the second line, the mesh is used as a blueprint to create a model. Note that the syntax is similar to what we used to load the mesh using the 3D engine, but this time the mesh is used to create a model. In English, the code is saying: "Use the cubeMesh blueprint to create a model in the scene and put it in the variable 'cube' ".</p>

<pre><code>ICamera* myCamera;
myCamera = myEngine->CreateCamera( kFPS );</code></pre>

                            The first line declares a variable named 'myCamera' that will be used hold a camera. The second line of code uses a similar syntax similar to what we have used when loading a mesh and creating a model. In English the code is saying: "Use myEngine to create a camera of type FPS and put it in the variable myCamera". FPS is a "first person shooter" camera that can be moved around with the mouse and cursor keys.</p>

                                We are now done with the initialisation section and the game loop section already has code that draws the scene when the game is executed. Therefore when you run the project now, the 3D engine draws the  scene using the viewpoint of our camera - the scene will be drawn into the window we opened earlier (in the initialisation section). We asked for a controllable FPS camera, so the image drawn will update and change as we move the camera around uisng keyboard or mouse.

void SetY( float ); // e.g. cube2->SetY( 10 );

void SetPosition ( float X, float Y, float Z ); // e.g. myModel->SetPosition( 20, 0, 10 );
