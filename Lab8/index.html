                                In games, we often need to detect when two models have collided. In this session you will see how to detect collisions using some simple mathematics.

                                In the real world a collision occurs when two moving objects meet. However, in a game world, a collision is often detected only when the models intersect.

                                Models are replaced with mathematically simple shapes that are big enough to completely surround them. These shapes are called bounding volumes because they define a boundary for the space occupied by the model. Common bounding volumes are spheres and cuboids. Bounding volumes are tested accurately for intersection against each other. 
                            </p>

                                This method will correctly find real collisions, but it will also incorrectly find collisions when the models are only close to each other. This issuecannot be elimniated, however it can be minimised by making the bounding sphere as small as possible.

                                Despite this drawback, this solution can be of great use. Where collision accuracy is not important and computational speed is important, then this is an excellent method. It is also very often used as an initial test in a more complex collision scheme: if a bounding sphere collision check fails then we can guarantee there is no collision and don’t need to spend time on a more accurate, complex test.

                               Different algorithms are used to detect collisions between bounding volumes depending on the types of volumes involved. In this lab, We will examine four cases:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Point – Sphere collisions</li>

                <h2>2. Point - Sphere Collision</h2>
                <div class="section_instrcutions"></div>
                    <ol>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                When testing for a collision between two models, sometimes it is possible to use a bounding volume for one model but only the position for the other. Effectively we are using a point as the bounding volume for the second model - this can be appropriate when the model is small. In this case we simply need to test if the point is within the sphere:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>   
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                    The collision will occur only if the distance between the point and the sphere centre is less than the sphere radius. We can find this distance using the vector methods from our previous work. The vector V between the point and the sphere centre is:V(X2 – X1, Y2 – Y1, Z2 – Z1)

                                    And the length D of this vector is:
                                    
                                        D =  
                                    If D is less than the sphere radius R then we have a collision. The code for this algorithm would look something like this:
                                    <pre><code>float x, y, z;
                                            x = SmallModel->GetX() - LargeModel->GetX();	// Using the large model’s
                                            y = SmallModel->GetY() - LargeModel->GetY();	// position as its
                                            z = SmallModel->GetZ() - LargeModel->GetZ();	// bounding sphere centre
                                        
                                            float collisionDist = sqrt( x*x + y*y + z*z );	// need #include <math.h>
                                        
                                            if (collisionDist < sphereRadius)
                                            {
                                                // Collision occurred…
                                            }
                                        </code></pre>
                            </p>

                                The process here is also fairly simple: there is a collision if the X, Y and Z coordinates of the point all lie within the three axis ranges defined by the bounding box. I.e. collision if:

                                X > XMin && X < XMax &&

                                So far the algorithms have been fairly simple. However, true collisions between spheres and boxes are rather more complex. We will use a trick to simplify things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expand the bounding box outwards by the sphere’s radius, i.e. XMin becomes XMin – Radius, XMax becomes XMax + Radius etc.</li>
                        <li>Shrink the sphere’s radius down to 0, i.e. assume it is a point.</li>
                        <li>Now we simply have the point-box collision situation again, and we can use the formula above.</li>
                        <li>•	This method won’t be accurate around the corners of the box, but using approximations like this is perfectly appropriate in some situations.
                        </li>
