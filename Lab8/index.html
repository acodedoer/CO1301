                                In the real world a collision occurs when two moving objects meet. However, in a game world, a collision is often detected only when the models intersect.

                                This is because of the way we update the position of the models by a small amount on each iteration of the game loop:

                                You cannot detect a collision by simply testing if the two models have the same position. In the diagram above, the two models above have collided even though their positions are different. However, testing if two complex objects intersect is both mathematically difficult and computationally expensive. We will look at a simple solution to this problem.

                <div class="section_instrcutions"></div>
                    <ol>

                                The most common solution to this problem is to replace the models with simpler shapes for the purpose of detecting collisions. For each model we choose a mathematically simple shape that is big enough to completely surround it. These simple shapes are tested accurately for intersection against each other. These shapes are called bounding volumes because they define a boundary for the space occupied by the model. Common bounding volumes are spheres and cuboids.
                            </p>
                            <img src="https://acodedoer.github.io/CO1301/Lab8/intersectioncheck.jpg" alt="checking whether two bounding spheres intersect"/>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">

                                This method will correctly find real collisions, but it will also incorrectly find collisions when the models are only close to each other. This can be minimised by making the bounding volume as small as possible (as in the diagram), but this problem cannot be eliminated (unless the object being tested the same shape as the bounding volume). 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Despite this drawback, this solution can be of great use. Where collision accuracy is not important and computational speed is important, then this is an excellent method. It is also very often used as an initial test in a more complex collision scheme: if a bounding sphere collision check fails then we can guarantee there is no collision and don’t need to spend time on a more accurate, complex test.

                                To <em><b>define a bounding sphere</b></em> (or any sphere, for that matter), we must choose the centre point and a radius. The most convenient centre point for a model is simply the position of the model. Then we need to choose a radius so that the sphere will completely surround the model. Selecting the distance from the centre to the furthest point on the model will achieve this. Alternatively this value can simply be estimated by measuring the model.
                            </p>

                            <p>This choice of sphere will not be ideal if the model origin is not perfectly centred (it isn’t in the diagram above). However it will suffice for our current examples.</p>

                                One of the main advantages of using a sphere for a bounding volume is that it remains constant under rotation. In other words, if we rotate the model, the bounding sphere does not change its profile/outline. This simplifies the mathematics immensely and makes spheres a good initial choice for models that can rotate.
                            </p>

                                Another common bounding volume is a box. The simplest form is an axis-aligned bounding box (sometimes called an AABB). The diagram below shows an example using the same model as above:
                            </p>
                            <img src = "https://acodedoer.github.io/CO1301/Lab8/boundingbox.jpg" alt="a box surrounding a star model"/>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                The box is called axis-aligned because its edges are parallel to the axes. This is convenient because it means the edges of the box define ranges on each of the axes. E.g. the top and bottom of this box define the range from 9 to 38 on the Y-axis. This simplifies the collision algorithms.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Notice how this volume more tightly contains the model in the example. This will lead to less incorrect collision detections. Bounding boxes frequently have this advantage over bounding spheres.

                                To define a bounding box we simply find the minimum and maximum X, Y and Z values for all the points in the model.

                                If we rotate the model when using a bounding box we must either:

                                    <li>
                                        Rotate the bounding box, but then it will not be axis-aligned and will lose some of its mathematical simplicity.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Resize the box and keep it axis-aligned, but this may be computationally expensive.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>So axis-aligned bounding boxes are better suited to models that do not rotate.</p>

                                When testing for a collision between two models, a small model and a large model, sometimes it is possible to use a bounding volume for one model (the large model) but only the position for the other (the small model). Effectively we are using a point as the bounding volume for the small model - this can be appropriate when the model is so small we simply need to test if its position, the point, is within the sphere bounding volume of the large model.

                                So far the algorithms have been fairly simple. However, true collisions between spheres and boxes are rather more complex. We will use a trick to simplify things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expand the bounding box outwards by the sphere’s radius, i.e. XMin becomes XMin – Radius, XMax becomes XMax + Radius etc.</li>
                        <li>Shrink the sphere’s radius down to 0, i.e. assume it is a point.</li>
                        <li>Now we simply have the point-box collision situation again, and we can use the formula from Section 8.</li>
                        <li>This method won’t be accurate around the corners of the box, but using approximations like this is perfectly appropriate in some situations.

                                You will need to reduce the movement speeds used in your program. You may want to set maximum speeds also.

                                Make the sphere move by the stored velocity every frame (regardless of key presses) and remove the cube jump.

                                Now when you detect a collision against the box try to make the sphere bounce. You will need to work out which side you hit (front/back or left/right) and then negate the appropriate velocity variable.
