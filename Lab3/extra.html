                        The instrucions in this lab sheet will guide through creating  (most of) a game called "The Field of Spikes". The game is played by flying a plane and shooting at giant spiky spikes that have mysteriously appeared all over the world. This guide will walk you through buidling most of the game, and other features can be added in the coming weeks as they are introduced in the labs, or even better you can try adding them even before then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will require the following: programming skills and concepts previous CO1301 and CO1404 labs, 3D manipulation skills from previous labs, the controls from this week's lab, and even a bit of your own creativity. Lets get started!!!

                               Now used the "plane.x" mesh to create a model at (0, 10, 0). Then in the gameloop give the plane a forward speed of 0.05 along the z axis by adding the code
                               <pre><code>plane->MoveZ( 0.05 );</code></pre>

                                When you run you program and move the camera around, the camera is directly behind the plan and does not provide a great view, the plane then speeds away from the camera and when you move the camera it is very easy to loose sight of the plane as it is a small model that is less than 10 units long on a floor that is 2000 x 2000 units. You can solve these issues in the next few steps.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Change your camera from "kFPS" to "kManual". Sets its position to (0, 40, -50) so that it is placed above and behind the plane. Then rotate it 40 units about the x axis so that it is looking down at the plane.</p>
<pre><code>myCamera->SetPosition(0, 40, -50);
myCamera->RotateX(20);</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                When you run your program, you will see that you have a better view of the plane when the program starts but then the plane speeds away and you loose sight of it. You can solve this by making the camera follow the plane while still keeping its initial distance and rotation relative to the plane.
                            </p>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Since the plane only moves forward (along the z axis) at this point, having the camera follow it means changing the z position of the camera as the z position of the plane changes, while keeping the other poisitons and rotations of the camera fixed. Therefore, below the code that moves the plane in the game loop, add a line of code that updates the z position of the camera to the z-position of the plane minus 50 (to maintain the same initial distance).
<pre><code>myCamera->SetZ(plane->GetZ() - 50);</code></pre>
                                <p>
                                    Run your program and you will see that the camera follows the plane as it moves forward.
                                </p>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Now using part of the code you wrote to control a camera with mouse movements in the lab, add code to the game loop to rotate the plane along the y axis using mouse movement.</p>
<pre><code>int mouseMoveX = myEngine->GetMouseMovementX();
plane->RotateY(mouseMoveX * 0.1);</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                On running you program you should note that although the plane rotates with mouse movements, it does not change its direction of movement. That is because it moved along the world-z not local-z, therefore change the code that moves your plane to:
<pre><code>plane->MoveLocalZ( 0.05 );</code></pre>
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                <p class= "instruction-item">The plane should be moving fine now, but you also need to update the camera so that it updates its x position when the plane is rotated and moves sideways. Thefore below the code:

                                        add the code:
                                        <pre><code>myCamera->SetX(plane->GetX());</code></pre>

                                You can scale models using the void Scale(float scale) method. You can use the method to scale the balls created by updating the code inside the if-condition that creates the ball model to the code below:
<pre><code>ball = ballMesh->CreateModel(plane->GetLocalX(), plane->GetLocalY(), plane->GetLocalZ());
ball->Scale(0.05);</code></pre>
                            </p>

                                Next restrict the firing of balls to one at a time, the fired ball gets automatically destroyed after a travelling a certain distance, then another one can be created. First create a boolean variable called "ballFired" in the initialisation section, and initialise it to false. Then update the condition of the if-condition that creates the ball model to check if the space key is hit and ballFired is false before creating the model. Then inside the if statement add code that changes ballFired to true.
<pre><code>ball = ballMesh->CreateModel(plane->GetLocalX(), plane->GetLocalY(), plane->GetLocalZ());
ball->Scale(0.05);
ballFired = true</code></pre>

                                Next create a float variable in the initialisation section called "ballDistance" and initialise it to 0. Then below the if-condition that creates the ball model in the gameloop, add another if-condition that checks if ballFired is true, within it at code to move the ball forward by 3 units and then add 3 to the variable ballDistance.</p>
<pre><code>ball = ballMesh->CreateModel(plane->GetLocalX(), plane->GetLocalY(), plane->GetLocalZ());
ball->Scale(0.05);</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                ballDistance will be used to check how far a fired ball has travelled so that it can be destroyed after a certain distance. Inside the if-statement created above add the if-statement below to destroy the ball when ballDistance has exceeded 2000 (you can try out different numbers to see what works best for you), then set ballFired to false so that a new ball can be fired, and reset ballDistance to 0.</p>
<pre><code>if (ballDistance >= 2000) {
    ballMesh->RemoveModel(ball);
    ballFired = false;
    ballDistance = 0;
}</code></pre>
                            <p>RemoveModel() method removes a model from a scene, but the pointer variable is still available to be reused. However trying to manipulate the variable without assigning a model to it will cause an error and crash your program</p>

                                    There is still one issue left, the balls are not always fired in the direction the plane is facing. You can fix that by keeping a record the units rotated by the plane, and rotating the ball when it is created. In the initialisation section declare and initialise a float variable named "totalRotation" to 0, and a boolean variable named "ballDirectionSet" to false. Then, below the line of code that rotates the plane based on the movement of the mouse:</p>
                                    <pre><code>plane->RotateY(mouseMoveX * 0.1);</code></pre>
                                    <p>add the code below to add the rotated units to totalRotation:</p>
                                    <pre><code>totalRotation += (mouseMoveX * 0.1);</code></pre>
                                   <p> Then in the if-statement that checks if ballFired is true, add the code below:</p>
<pre><code>if (firedDirectionSet == false) {
    ball->RotateY(totalRotation);
    firedDirectionSet = true;
}</code></pre>
                                <p>Finally, in the if-statement that checks if the ball has travelled anough distance to be destroyed, add a line of code to set firedDirectionSet to false after the ball is destroyed.</p>
