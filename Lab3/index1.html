                                    In the previous two weeks we introduced the TL-Engine and used it to manipulate some simple 3D graphics. We have also used a FPS camera which is controlled using the cursor keys and the mouse.
                               </p>

                                It would be better if you could set up the camera controls, speed and rotation based on your own preferences and the machine you are working on. Therefore in this session you will create your own camera controls.

                                Remember you will need to keep the code that you write. For example, you will be expected to re-use the camera control code you write today for use in later weeks. Therefore, as always, make sure you save copies of your code and projects in secure accessible locations.

                            <p class= "instruction-item">It is possible to change the skin on a model (the image that is drawn on the geometry). To do so, you will need to use this method on the model:
<pre><code>void SetSkin( const string& sFileName );
// Example usage: sphere->SetSkin( "Marine2.jpg" );
//only works for models that use a single texture.
</code></pre>
                            </p>

                                The TL-Engine sets a default location for all of its media files. This location is set in the initialisation section as part of the template: <TL_Engine class="">     
<pre><code>myEngine->AddMediaFolder( "C\\..." ); </code></pre></TL_Engine>
                                The path provided as a paramter to the function above is the location of the media files. This will probably be a folder in C on your home computer. If you look inside the directory you can examine the media files installed with TL-Engine.</p>

                                Now add and display a sphere in your scene so that you can change its skin. Here are some examples of textures designed to be used with the sphere:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Clouds.jpg</li>

                                Use the SetSkin() method to change the skin of the sphere. For example to use "Jupiter.jpg" as the skin, add the code below after creating the sphere model:
                                <pre><code>sphere->SetSkin( "Jupiter.jpg" );</code></pre>
                    <li>

                                Add code to move the sphere left and right between X = -40 and X = 40. Make the sphere roll while it moves and change the texture of the sphere every time that it changes direction. You can use textures of your choice.

// the top-left of the 3D engine window).
int GetMouseX();

// Returns the Y position of the mouse (vertical position relative to
// the top-left of the 3D engine window).
int GetMouseY();

// Returns the X mouse movement since the last call to this function
int GetMouseMovementX();

// Returns the Y mouse movement since the last call to this function
int GetMouseMovementY();</code></pre>
                            The first two methods return the X and Y position of the mouse cursor in the engine window. This can be used for clicking on buttons or icons - we won’t be using these methods right now.
                            <br><br>
                            The second two methods tell you how much the mouse has been moved in the X and Y directions (since the last time you asked). This is a common way to control the rotation of 3D objects.
