                                You are going to carry on with the previous matchbox racer program. You can use own version of the program if it easily available otherwise download the code from the website and use it instead. It uses the keys ‘W’, ‘S’ ‘A’ & ‘D’ to drive the matchbox, cursors and mouse to move the camera.

                                LookAt() is a method for models (or cameras) that points the local Z-axis towards another model. This effectively makes the first model/camera look at the second:
                                <pre><code>model1->LookAt( sphere );</code></pre>
                            </p>

                                Use the new ‘LookAt’ function to make the turret always point at the matchbox. Think carefully whether to put this in the game setup or game loop section. Move the car around to test that the turret continues to point at the car.

                                Create a new integer variable (in the setup area) called ‘shoot’ and initialise it to –1. You will use this variable to track a bullet fired by the turret:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When it is –1 there is no bullet</li>
                                    <li>When a bullet is created we set this variable to a large value that will count down as the bullet travels – this is the life-time of the bullet</li>
                                    <li>When the counter reaches 0 the bullet will be destroyed - then we will reset the value to -1 to indicate there is no bullet again</li>
                                    <li>This will allow the turret to fire one bullet at a time, and the bullet will have a limited range depending on its life-time</li>

These variables will be used in exactly the same way as the vector was used in the Week 9 lab to move the particle.

                                    The direction of movement between two points is described by a vector. In order to fire a bullet at the car you need to know the direction of movement between the turret and the car. The vector between two points is calculated by subtracting the position of one point from the position of the second point.
                            <pre><code>float vectorX;
                                    float vectorY;

                                As you can see, one of the immediate advantages of using a vector is that you don't have to change any code within the game loop. All you have to consider is the direction of movement and set up the appropriate vector. This is how all movement within a graphics engine is dealt with. All models within 3D graphics are moved using vectors.

                                Within the game loop add a new MoveY() command in your code so that the particle also moves by windY each frame.

                                Run the program. As you can see the particle is falling diagonally. The net effect of applying the wind vector is as if you had one vector of value (  -0.005,  -0.005, 0  ).

                                 Vectors can be added together. Two vectors added together produce one new vector. When two vectors are added together you sum the x values of the two vectors, then the y values and finally the z values. So

                                You can verify this by experimenting with the values of the movement vector of the particle and the wind vector. You will explore vectors in a more detail in next week's worksheet.
