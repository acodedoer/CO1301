                                LookAt() is a method for models (or cameras) that points the local Z-axis towards another model. This effectively makes the first model/camera look at the second:

                                        <li>When shoot is –1 there is no bullet and one needs to be created</li>

                                        <li>When the value of shoot reaches 0 the bullet will be destroyed - then we will reset the value of shoot to -1 to indicate there is no bullet again</li>
                                        <li>This will allow enemyDrone to fire one bullet at a time, and the bullet will have a limited range depending on its life-time</li>

                                    In order for enemyDrone to fire a bullet at playerDrone, the direction of movement between playerDrone and enemyDrone must be known. The direction of movement between two points is described by a vector. The vector between the two points that the two models are positioned at can be calculated by subtracting the position of one point from the position of the second point. An example of how this can be done is shown below:
<pre><code>float vectorX;
float vectorY;
float vectorZ;
vectorX = Model2->GetX() – Model1->GetX();
vectorY = Model2->GetY() – Model1->GetY();
vectorZ = Model2->GetZ() – Model1->GetZ();

                                Note: the order in which you perform the subtraction above will affect the direction of your vector.

                                In the game loop, write code to calculate the vector from enemyDrone to playerDrone. The x, y and z coordinates of enemyDrone and playerDrone can be found using GetX(), GetY() and GetZ() methods. The result of the calculation each component of the vector should be assigned to vectorX, vectorY and vectorZ as shown in the code snippet above.

Use simple multiplication to derive the square of any two values e.g.
                                <pre><code>distanceX = vectorX * vectorX; // distanceX squared</code></pre>

                            Sum the squares of the components and then calculate the square root of the result to get the length of the vector. There is a function within C++ to calculate square roots called sqrt(). To use it, you need to add the following two lines of code to the top of your program.
<pre><code>#include &ltiostream>
using namespace std;</code></pre>
                            This will give you access to the C++ maths library and to the sqrt() function. The function takes just one parameter e.g.
<pre><code>float root;
root = sqrt( 9*9 ); // the square root of 9 squared
</code></pre>
                            Now use the sqrt() method to caluclate the distance between enemyDrone and playerDrone (the length of the vector). Use a new float varibale called "distance" to store the distance calculated.

In order to use these values to move a bullet fired by enemyDrone towards playerDrone you are going to have to calculate the direction vector between the two drones, therefore you have to normalise the vector you have derived.

                                L, then the direction vector is

                                Check that you are dividing the each vector component by the distance and not, for example,  distanceX by distance.

                                After the calculations from the previous step, use an ‘if’ statement to test:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        If the distance between enemyDrone and playerDrone is less than 250 (use your float variable "distance")
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        and the shoot variable is equal to –1
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <br/>
                                If both these conditions are true then:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Using the IModel* variable named bullet you declared in the initialisation section, create a bullet model using bulletMesh. Create it in the same position as enemyDrone. Note that you are creating the model inside the game loop.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Initialise the bullet direction vector variables using directionX, directionY and directionZ from above.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Set the shoot variable to 500 – this will be the life-time of the bullet.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                   
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                                Now add another ‘if’ statement to test if the ‘shoot’ variable is greater than 0. If so, then move the bullet model by the bullet direction vector.
<pre><code>bullet->MoveX( directionX );
bullet->MoveY( directionY );
bullet->MoveZ( directionZ );
</code></pre> 
Also, decrement the shoot variable by 1 here so that the bullet life decreases as it travels.  
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Add a final ‘if’ statement that tests if the ‘shoot’ variable is equal to 0. If so destroy the bullet model. You need a statement like:
                                <pre><code>bulletMesh->RemoveModel( bullet );</code></pre>
                                Then, set the shoot variable to –1 as there is no bullet now
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>  
                    <li>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                You should now have an enemy drone that tracks your drone and shoots at it when it comes near. Read the code you have written paying special attention to the logic that is used to create and destroy the bullets.
