                                Create a new TL-Engine project called Lab9_Text_Project.

                                Create a kManual camera at position (0, 0, 0), then implement camera control using keyboard and mouse as you did in Lab3_CameraControl_Project.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Before utilising text in the TL-Engine, you need to load a font in the game set-up area of your code:
                            </p>
<pre><code>IFont* myFont = myEngine->LoadFont( "Comic Sans MS", 36 );
// Load "Comic Sans MS" font at 36 points
</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                As you can see, fonts are loaded in a similar way to meshes. A new data type: IFont is used for the fonts. As with meshes you need the both the data type of the variable and a name for the variable.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                You can load any system font e.g. Times New Roman, Adobe Garamond Pro, Comic Sans MS, Monotype Corsiva, stencil std, Charlemagne std etc. Not every font is guarantee to work correctly. Experiment and see what happens. If none is loaded, the font defaults to 24 point Arial.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Once a font has been loaded you can draw text with it. However,  the text will only be drawn for one frame. In order to keep the text permanent you must put the code for drawing the text in the game loop
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>myFont->Draw( "Hello World", 200, 100 );</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                Adding the code above to your game-loop should display "Hello World" on your screen.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Copy over the camera movement code you created in Lab3_CameraControl_Project and use to it to control your camera. Once you have done this move the camera around. What did you notice?

                                Text (and Sprites as you'll see later on) use a different coordinate system to the one used to draw 3D models. Text uses the X and Y axes of the screen. This alternative coordinate system is the same as the one used by the mouse. The screen axes look like this:
                            </p>

                                The origin ( 0, 0) of the coordinate system is at the top left of the screen. Y increases as you go down the screen, whilst x increase as you go to the right.

                                Set up the cursor keys so that they change the values of fontX and fontY within the game loop and so move the text. The cursor keys are: Key_Up, Key_Down, Key_Right and Key-Left. You should then be able to move the location of the text around the screen.

                                There are a number of other things that you can do with the ‘Draw’. The Draw method is defined as:
                            </p>
<pre><code>Draw( const string& sText, const int iX, const int iY,
    const unsigned int uiColour,
    const EHorizAlignment eHorizAlign, const EVertAlignment eVertAlign )</code></pre>
                            <p>An example of use is:</p>
<pre><code>// This will draw red text, centre aligned at the coordinates (100, 300)
myFont->Draw( "Hello Again", 100, 300, kRed, kCentre );

//The will draw the phrase in blue in exactly the centre of the screen.
myFont->Draw( "Hello Again", 320, 240, kBlue, kCentre, kVCentre );</code></pre>
                        </div>

                                    The colour of the text is specified in the fourth parameter of the method. The following standard colours are supported:

                                To output more complex text (including variables or functions/methods) you need to be introduced to a new part of C++. You may have used "cout" in this module or in CO1401 in conjunction with the double chevron "<<" to direct text output to the screen, e.g.
                            </p>
                            <pre><code>cout << "hello world";</code></pre>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                However, it is also possible to use the ‘stringstream’ type, which can be used like ‘cout’ to create a string. In order to use the stringstream data type you need to include the sstream library. Add these two lines of code at the top of the program
                            </p>
<pre><code>#include <sstream>
using namespace std;</code></pre>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="list-div">
                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Create a variable of type stringstream to hold the text you want to draw on the screen. Declare the variable within the game loop, otherwise you'll get problems with repeating text.
                            </p>
<pre><code>stringstream outText;
outText << "White Position: " << whiteBall->GetX();
myFont ->Draw( outText.str(), 20, 20 );
outText.str(""); // Clear myStream</code></pre>
                            <p>
                                Note the use of the str() command in conjunction with outText. This command converts the stringstream data type into a string of characters ready to be sent to the draw method. In the last line of code the str() command is used to empty the text.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <p class= "instruction-item">
                                Although stringstream gives you access to functionality similar to "cout" do note that outputting newlines (endl or ‘\n’) has no effect in the TL-Engine - use more than one ‘Draw’ call instead.
                            </p>

                                Return to the code you wrote in Exercise 2. Include the stringstream library. Remember that you need to use the std namespace as well.

                                You are going to draw the text using fontX and fontY again. However, in this case the text you are going to draw is the actual values using fontX and fontY. In other words, write the values of using fontX and fontY into the stringstream variable and draw this newly created text on to the screen. The numbers will, of course, change as you move the text around the screen.

                                The alignment of the text can be changed as well. You need to specify all 6 parameters in order to use horizontal and vertical alignment. Horizontal alignment refers to the horizontal positioning of the text in relation to the coordinates specified. By default the text starts at the given coordinates (i.e. it is left aligned). However, the text can be centred at the coordinates or right aligned. The constants for horizontal alignment are:

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Vertical alignment refers to the vertical positioning of the text in relation to the coordinates specified. The constants for vertical alignment are:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>
                                It will prove particularly useful to be able to centre align the text, e.g. if you want some text to appear centred at a location rather than extending only to the right.

                                Sprites are 2D bitmaps. Sprites were once used to draw all of the graphics in games. However, with the introduction of 3D graphics they are no longer the centre of computer graphics.

                                Whilst models have overtaken sprites as the mainstay of computer graphics, sprites are still extremely important.

                                In this section you will use a sprite as backdrop for a User Interface.

                                In many ways you will find the sprite operations similar to those of models. However, sprites are simpler in as much as you only have to consider movement in 2D: up and down, or left and right. The sprites do have a Z component, but this is only used to sort the sprites, i.e. to calculate which sprite is in front, and hence visible, if two or more sprites overlap.

                                The naming convention follows the format you are familiar with. Essentially you can replace the word Model with the word Sprite. An important difference is that you do not need to load a Mesh.

                                Sprites are created using CreateSprite(). Formally CreateSprite is a method of myEngine. There are a set of movement and positioning methods for sprites. These are: GetX, GetY, SetX, SetY, SetZ, SetPosition, MoveX, MoveY, and Move.All pixel coordinates are in *floating point*

Use the GetX, GetY and GetZ methods and the text output technique you have just learnt to output the current X, Y, and Z coordinates of the sphere as you move it around. The values should be drawn in the User Interface area.
